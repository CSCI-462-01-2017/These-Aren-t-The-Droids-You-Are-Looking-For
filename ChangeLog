We are happy to announce FreedroidRPG 0.11 - release candidate 1.
FreedroidRPG 0.11 represents one year of work on the game, and has
therefore significantly evolved since 0.10.3.
The list of changes is huge, and consists of bug fixes, performance improvements,
interface work notably for the leveleditor, and game content improvements.
Here are the most important points:
 
Content
----
- modified the endgame scenario and started integrating the Hell Fortress, adding 2 more levels
 
- added a secret research center level
 
- changed town to make it more "lifelike" and easier to find yourself around
 
- modified start level to improve richness of content
 
- added and rebalanced weapons. There now are a few melee weapons, projectile pistols and rifles, and futuristic energy weapons.
 
- changed and rebalanced programs, including added a new default skill to help tux from overheating. Makes a "magic user" character a possible and interesting alternative.
 
- new music tracks 
 
 
Engine
----
 
- the savegame system has been rewritten to use plain text instead of binary dumps. This allows compatibility of savegames
between platforms and makes them hand-editable, and usable for bug reporting.
 
- using a texture atlas for floor tiles in OpenGL mode yields a 20%+ performance improvement
 
- fixed many bugs in robot AI
 
- using a better collision detection algorithm, and pathfind bots waypoint routes, in an attempt to reduce bots getting into walls
 
- full translation support for game data based on gettext
 
 
Leveleditor
----
 
- undo/redo feature
 
- nicer buttons in the interface
 
- changed the mouse interface to match The Sims editor more closely (move with right button pressed, place
  tile with left click)
 
- ability to place line of walls by dragging the mouse
 
- ability to fill a given rectangle with floor tiles by dragging
 
- "quickbar" for favorite tiles
