Various header files in the src directory:

                      that are needed in various files simultaneously are
                      contained in here. 
global.h            : This is also a most important header file.  All

                      various different .c files must have an external/not
                      external line here.  This file must be included 
                      in order to gain access to such functions in other .c files.
struct.h            : This is a most important header file.  All data
                      structure types, that are special to the project

                      importance to the whole game, that are declared 
                      as external in global.h


The C program code files in the src directory:
----------------------------------------------
blocks.c            : contains block operating functions, that is when you
                      want to put something on the visible screen 
                      of the paradroid, DO NOT DO IT YOURSELF!  Use one of
                      the functions in here, e.g. DisplayBlock(..),
                      DisplayMergeBlock(..), CopyMergeBlock(...),.. . 
                      These functions already take into account the
                      position of the paradoid, so you do not have to
                      worry about where to put anything, and only have to
                      supply map coordinates.  Very handy. 

bullet.c            : all Bullet and Blast related functions.  

enemy.c             : All enemy - related functions.  This includes their
                      whole behaviour, healing, initialization, shuffling
                      them around after evevator-transitions of the
                      paradroid, deleting them, collisions of enemies among
                      themselves, their firing, animation and such. 

graphics.c          : Graphics primitives, such as functions to load LBM
                      or PCX images, to change the vga colour table, to
                      activate or deactivate monitor signal, to set video
                      modes etc. 

influ.c             : all features, movement, firing, collision and
                      extras of the influencer are done in here. 

map.c               : All map-related functions, which also includes
                      loading of decks and whole ships, starting the
                      elevators and consoles if close to the paradroid,
                      refreshes as well as determining the map brick that
                      contains specified coordinates are done in this
                      file. 

misc.c              : This file shall contain miscellaneous helpful
                      functions for paraplus, that do not belong elsewhere 

main.c              : This is the main program file.  Is should preferably
                      only contain main and some definitions 

init.c              : This file contains functions to initialize the game
                      procedure, e.g. Title, InitNewGame, InitParaplus. 

text.c              : contains all functions dealing with the HUGE, BIG
                      font used for the top status line, the score and
                      the text displayed during briefing and highscore
                      inverview.  This has NOTHING to do with the fonts 
                      of the SVGALIB or the fonts used for the horizontal
                      scrolling message line! 

sound.c             : all functions dealing with sound are contained in this file.

ship.c              : the console and elevator functions

takeover.c          : Everything that has to do with the takeover game of
                      Paradroid is contained in this file. 

view.c              : all the functions managing the things one gets to
                      see.  That includes assembling of enemies, assembling
                      the currently relevant porting of the map (the
                      bricks I mean), drawing all visible elements like
                      bullets, blasts, enemies or influencer in a
                      nonvisible place in memory at first,  and finally
                      drawing them to the visible screen for the user.
