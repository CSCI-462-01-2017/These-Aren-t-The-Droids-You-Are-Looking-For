Currently the FreedroidRPG development team needs:

* Artists
We have a lack of skilled graphics artists, especially those that can create pretty things with 3D tools. All current graphics sources are .blend, but whatever software is your preference is fine by us, as long as the sources are saved in a format accessible to free tools like eg Blender.

* Coders
The more coders the more new features and bug fixes. So if you like FreedroidRPG, know C or some other language we could use (no, we will not rewrite the entire game to use [insert random language preference]) then do not be afraid to get in touch with us on IRC or the mailing list. :)

* Content creators
What's the point of having code and pretty graphics if you do not have content? Designing maps and really good dialogs and story lines takes good imagination and a lot of time. So even if you know nothing about programing or drawing, your contribution can be very useful indeed. At the end of the day, it's the content that makes or breaks an RPG game. 

* Translators
The more available languages, the more people of all ages from different countries can enjoy this game. So if you are natively speaking in a language still not translated, please help us out.


We also try to keep an up to date list of things & ideas we would like to implement on the Wiki. 
Take a peak, maybe there is something there that might be something you can help out with. :)

Finally, remember that no contribution is too small to be interesting. :)
