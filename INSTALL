FreedroidRPG Installation 
=========================

To build FreedroidRPG from source on a Unix-like system, you will use the "standard" GNU autotools way.

Dependencies
============

FreedroidRPG requires the following libraries, along with, on the Linux distributions that split them, their associated -dev package.
Make sure you install them before attempting to build.

SDL
SDL_image
SDL_gfx
SDL_mixer (optional)
libogg (optional)
libvorbis (optional)
OpenGL (optional)

The packages to install are listed below, depending on your distribution.

1) Debian/Ubuntu

sudo apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev libsdl-gfx1.2-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev libogg-dev

2) Fedora

(To be done)

3) Archlinux

pacman -S sdl sdl_image sdl_gfx sdl_mixer libogg

4) Please contribute lists for your distribution!

Building with autotools
=========================

1) Open a terminal. 
   a) Via right click in some file browsers.
   
   b) Via main menu (usually "System" entry).
      Move to the FreedroidRPG source directory using "cd ./XYZ/" command. XYZ = path to the FreedroidRPG source.
   
2) If you are running an SVN version of the game, you will first need to generate the 
   configure script by running:
   ./autogen.sh
   If you don't know what the SVN version is, you are not running it and can skip this step.

3) Run the configure script: 
   ./configure
   You can check the options it accepts with --help.
   If you are running MAC OSX you will probably want to use ./configure --with-apple-opengl-framework
   During the configure process, the terminal may notify you that some software is required.
   Install the required packages and restart ./configure.

4) If ./configure finishes without errors or warnings, then proceed with building the game with:
   make

5) Installation
   a) "make install" will install the game system-wide. You need to be root for this. The binary name is freedroidRPG.

      Hint: you can speed up "make" process using "make -j n". Replace "n" with number of jobs.
      For more information execute "make --help".

   b) If you are working with the source tree and want to svn update regularly we 
      recommend the following instead: 
      Do not issue "make install", instead, simply go to the src/ subdirectory, and run
      ./freedroidRPG.



Cross compile for Windows with autotools
========================================

Provided you have a cross compiler installed and set up (see
below for more details), use the following configure line:

$ ./configure  --prefix=/path/to/the/cross/compiler --host=i686-pc-mingw32 --without-x --enable-nls LIBS="-lintl"

One critical point is to make sure you have all required libraries installed. 
You will need to have libogg and libvorbis for sound and music, and will need libintl and its dependencies
to provide translation support.

The binary we ship supports all those features and is built with autotools.
In special cases we may agree to sending you the complete cross-compiler archive so you can build win32 binaries
easily.

If you have problems with the compilation/installation, please

or send a mail to freedroid-discussion@lists.sourceforge.net.
