FreedroidRPG Installation 
=========================

To build FreedroidRPG from source on a Unix-like system, you will use the "standard" GNU autotools way.

Building with autotools
=========================

1) If you are running an SVN version of the game, you will first need to generate the 
   configure script by running ./autogen.sh.

2) Run the configure script, ./configure
   You can check the options it accepts with --help.
   If you are running MAC OSX you will probably want to use ./configure --with-apple-opengl-framework

3) Type "make" to build the game.

4) Installation
  a) "make install" will install the game. The binary name is freedroidRPG.

  b) If you are working with the source tree and want to svn update regularly we 
     recomend the following instead : 
     Do not issue "make install", instead, simply go to the src/ subdirectory, and run
     ./freedroidRPG. 

Cross compile for Windows with autotools
========================================

Provided you have a cross compiler installed and set up (see
below for more details), use the following configure line:

$ ./configure  --prefix=/path/to/the/cross/compiler --host=i686-pc-mingw32 --without-x --enable-nls LIBS="-lintl"

One critical point is to make sure you have all required libraries installed. 
You will need to have libogg and libvorbis for sound and music, and will need libintl and its dependencies
to provide translation support.

The binary we ship supports all those features and is built with autotools.
In special cases we may agree to sending you the complete cross-compiler archive so you can build win32 binaries
easily.

==============================================================
If you have problems with the compilation/installation, please
contact us : #freedroid on irc.freenode.net (we don't bite!),
or send a mail to freedroid-discussion@lists.sourceforge.net.
