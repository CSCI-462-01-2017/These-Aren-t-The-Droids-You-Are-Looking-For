1. Introduction
================
 This game tells the story of a world destroyed by a conflict between the droids and their human
 masters. Play as Tux in a quest to save the world from the murderous rebel droids who know no
 mercy. You get to choose which path you wish to follow, and freedom of choice is everywhere 
 in the game.

 FreedroidRPG features a complete real time combat system with melee and ranged weapons, fairly
 similar to the proprietary game Diablo. There also is an innovative system of magic, with features such as 
 forced casting and over 20 spells. You can use over 50 different kinds of items and fight countless 
 enemies on your way to your destiny. We have an advanced dialogue system, which aims at being at
 least on par with Fallout's. The dialogues in the game represent a large part of the gameplay. 
 Finally, if guns are too inaccurate and blades too messy, you can always take over your enemies and
 have them fight on your side.


2. Install
===========
 Please refer to the INSTALL file located in the same folder as this file.


3. Controls
============
 Movement
 
  The game is controlled using the mouse. Left click onto the locations you want to move to.  Hold 
  the button down to keep moving in that direction.  Holding down CTRL key will make you run.


 Attack

  Left clicking an enemy will cause Tux to come close to the droid and to start attacking it with the 
  current weapon. If the current weapon is a gun then Tux will stand still and shoot the droid.

4. Known Issues
================
- General
   * Most melee and ranged weapons only have placeholder laserswords/rifles for their Tux holding 
     and attack animations. If you are skilled with 3D modelling, please help us out.
   * Nvidia Geforce 8&9 cards: Transparency in some parts of the game works incorrectly. E.g. instead of 
     making the walls semi transparent when Tux comes close (in "key T" mode), they vanish completely.

- Windows 
   * Using the tool IZarc to unpack the downloaded zip breaks the game. IZarc apparently can not 
     handle filenames without extensions. Please use other options, e.g. 7zip, winzip, winrar etc, to 
     correctly unpack the game.
   * The game will use the system language by default, you cannot select another language in-game.

- Linux
   * Pulseaudio: Using SDL-pulseaudio you are currently likely to not get sound. This has nothing to do 
     with FDRPG but with Pulseaudio and it's plugins still in general being unmature. We recomend using
     eg SDL-esd or SDL-alsa until these problems has been fixed upstream. If you manage to get a working 
     config, do let us know so we can update this entry with versionnumbers etc.
   * AMD/ATI R300 graphics cards: Mesa 6.5.2 does not support user clipping planes which breaks the 
     text in freedroidRPG. Upgrading to Mesa 7 should fix this.
   * When playing in SDL windowed mode, teleporting has the side effect of changing the brightness
     of the whole screen instead of just the game window, if the option
     (Options -> Performance Tweaks ->) Skip fadings is set to "NO".
   * Ubuntu: Changing language in game will not work by default since Ubuntu does not ship with standard 
     ISO locales, only UTF-8 versions. You will have to manually correct this to get it working.
     Procedure
        1) In commandline write 
                sudo nano /var/lib/locales/supported.d/local
        2) Add the locales you are interested in, 1 entry on each line, e.g.
                de_DE ISO-8859-15
                fr_FR ISO-8859-15
                sv_SE ISO-8859-15
                ru_RU.cp1251 cp1251
        3) Run
                sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales
        4) You should now be able to chose the corresponding languages in the in game menu.


5. Screen resolution
=====================
 There are a few hidden high resolution settings only accessible from commandline. They are badly tested 
 and thus generally considered to be buggy and are unsupported. They however can still be quite useful for
 many, especially for widescreen LCDs in fullscreen mode. 

 To get an up-to-date list of available resolutions use "freedroidRPG -r99".

 Some known issues for the unsupported resolutions:
    - Portrait image in dialogs overflows its borders
    - Off center light radius
    - Incorrect text scrolling when talking to NPCs at times


6. Commands
============
 Execute "freedroidRPG --help" (in a terminal) to get a list of commandline options.


7. Level editor
================
 There is a level editor integrated into the game. It can be accessed from the main menu.
