1. Introduction:
================
 This game tells the story of a world destroyed by a conflict between the bots and their human
 masters. Play as Tux in a quest to save the world from the murderous rebel bots who know no
 mercy. You get to choose which path you wish to follow, and freedom of choice is everywhere 
 in the game.

 FreeDroidRPG features a complete real time combat system with melee and ranged weapons, fairly
 similar to the proprietary game Diablo. There also is an innovative system of magic, with 
 features such as forced casting and over 20 spells. You can use over 50 different kinds of 
 items and fight countless enemies on your way to your destiny. We have an advanced dialogue 
 system, which aims at being at least on par with Fallout's. The dialogues in the game represent 
 a large part of the gameplay. Finally, if guns are too inaccurate and blades too messy, you can 
 always take over your enemies and have them fight on your side.
