1. Introduction:
================
 This game tells the story of a world destroyed by a conflict between the bots and their human
 masters. Play as Tux in a quest to save the world from the murderous rebel bots who know no
 mercy. You get to choose which path you wish to follow, and freedom of choice is everywhere 
 in the game.

 FreeDroidRPG features a complete real time combat system with melee and ranged weapons, fairly
 similar to the proprietary game Diablo. There also is an innovative system of magic, with 
 features such as forced casting and over 20 spells. You can use over 50 different kinds of 
 items and fight countless enemies on your way to your destiny. We have an advanced dialogue 
 system, which aims at being at least on par with Fallout's. The dialogues in the game represent 
 a large part of the gameplay. Finally, if guns are too inaccurate and blades too messy, you can 
 always take over your enemies and have them fight on your side.

2. Install:
================
 Please refer to the INSTALL file located in the same folder as this file.

3. Known Issues:
================
 * In Ubuntu, changing language will not work since Ubuntu by default does not ship with standard ISO
   locales, only UFT-8 versions. You will have to manually correct this to get it working.
   Procedure
        1) In commandline write 
                sudo nano /var/lib/locales/supported.d/local
        2) Add the locales you are interested in, 1 entry on each line, eg
                de_DE ISO-8859-1
                fr_FR ISO-8859-1
                sv_SE ISO-8859-1
        3) Run
                sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales
        4) You Should now be able to chose the corresponding languages in the in game menu.

 * There are a few hidden resolutions that might be useful for widescreen LCDs in fullscreen mode. 
   They are badly tested and thus generally considered to be buggy or at least unsupported. Thus they
   can only be accessed from the commandline. 
   Start with "freedroid -r 99" to get a list of the current available options.
