1. Introduction:
================
 This game tells the story of a world destroyed by a conflict between the bots and their human
 masters. Play as Tux in a quest to save the world from the murderous rebel bots who know no
 mercy. You get to choose which path you wish to follow, and freedom of choice is everywhere 
 in the game.

 FreeDroidRPG features a complete real time combat system with melee and ranged weapons, fairly
 similar to the proprietary game Diablo. There also is an innovative system of magic, with 
 features such as forced casting and over 20 spells. You can use over 50 different kinds of 
 items and fight countless enemies on your way to your destiny. We have an advanced dialogue 
 system, which aims at being at least on par with Fallout's. The dialogues in the game represent 
 a large part of the gameplay. Finally, if guns are too inaccurate and blades too messy, you can 
 always take over your enemies and have them fight on your side.


2. Install:
================
 Please refer to the INSTALL file located in the same folder as this file.


3. Screen resolution:
=====================
 There are a few hidden high resolution settings only accessible from commandline. They are badly tested 
 and thus generally considered to be buggy and are unsupported. They however still be quite useful for many,
 especially for widescreen LCDs in fullscreen mode. 

 At this writing the following resolutions are implemented

     These codes correspond to the following resolutions available:
     0 = 640 x 480 (default with SDL)
     1 = 800 x 600 (default with OpenGL)
     2 = 1024 x 748 
     3 = 1280 x 1024 
     4 = Unsupported! (1280 x 800) 
     5 = Unsupported! (1440 x 900) 
     6 = Unsupported! (1680 x 1050) 
 
 Start with eg the commandline "freedroid -r 4" to choose a specific resolution.
 To get a current up to date list of available resolutions use "freedroid -r 99"

 Some know issues for these unsupported resolutions:
 - Portrait image in dialoges overflows it's borders.
 - Off center lighting radious.
 - Text scrolling when talking to NPCs might be incorrect at times.
 - Map edges might be visable when moving from one level to the next.
 - On roughly 1000 or more vertical resolution and FULL SCREEN, dialogs sometimes switch back and forth between
   full world and black background.


4. Known Issues:
================
- General
  * Path tracing in the game is partially buggy. Sometimes NPCs, bots or even Tux eg can walk from A to B but
  not from B to A. This eg causes the town Doctor to "get stuck" in the toilet (though possibly he just had
  something bad for dinner). We are working on solving this and several related issues, but it has proven to be
  quite difficult.
  * Most melee and ranged weapons only have placeholder laserswords/rifles for their Tux holding and attack 
  animations. If you are skilled with 3D modelling, please help us out to fix this.

- Windows 
  * Using the tool IZarc to unpack the downloaded zip breaks the game. IZarc apparently can not handle filenames
  without ".fileextention" at the end. Please use other options, eg 7zip, winzip, winrar etc, to correctly unpack
  the game.


- Ubuntu
  * Changing language in game will not work by default since Ubuntu does not ship with standard ISO locales, 
  only UTF-8 versions. You will have to manually correct this to get it working.
  Procedure
        1) In commandline write 
                sudo nano /var/lib/locales/supported.d/local
        2) Add the locales you are interested in, 1 entry on each line, eg
                de_DE ISO-8859-15
                fr_FR ISO-8859-15
                sv_SE ISO-8859-15
                ru_RU.cp1251 cp1251
        3) Run
                sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales
        4) You Should now be able to chose the corresponding languages in the in game menu.


5. Controls:
=============
 Movement:

 The game is controlled using the mouse:  Left click onto the locations you want to move to.  Hold 
 the button down to keep moving in that direction.  Holding down CTRL key will make you run.

 Attacking:

 Left clicking an enemy will cause Tux to come close to the bot and to start attacking it with the 
 current weapon. If the current weapon is a gun then Tux will stand still and shoot the bot.
