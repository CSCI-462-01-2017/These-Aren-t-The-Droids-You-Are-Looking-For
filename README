1. Introduction
================
 The game tells the story of a world destroyed by a conflict between
 robots and their human masters. Play as Tux in a quest to save the
 world from the murderous rebel bots who know no mercy. You get to
 choose which path you wish to follow, and freedom of choice is
 everywhere in the game.

 FreedroidRPG features a real time combat system with melee and ranged
 weapons, fairly similar to the proprietary game Diablo. There is an
 innovative system of programs that can be run in order to take
 control of enemy robots, alter their behavior, or improve one's
 characteristics. You can use over 150 different kinds of items and
 fight countless enemies on your way to your destiny. An advanced
 dialog system provides story background and immersive role playing
 situations.

 The game is complete, fully playable, and can provide about 10 hours
 of fun. It is still being actively developed, and help is welcome in
 many areas. People having - or trying to acquire - programming, map
 editing, or writing skills will find FreedroidRPG to be an exciting,
 fast-moving project in which they can fully express their creativity.

2. Install & Play
===========
 For general help with installation, please refer to the INSTALL file located in the same folder as this file.
 Specific instructions for Ubuntu:  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=6127097#post6127097

 To run the game you normally just have to launch the executable.
 For advanced options execute "freedroidRPG --help" (in a terminal) to get a list of command line options.


3. Controls
============
 Movement
 
  The game is controlled using the mouse. Left click onto the locations you want to move to.  Hold
  the button down to keep moving in that direction.  Holding down CTRL key will make you run.

 Attack

  Left clicking an enemy will cause Tux to come close to the droid and to start attacking it with the
  current weapon. If the current weapon is a gun then Tux will stand still and shoot the droid.

4. Known Issues
================
 General
   * Some melee and ranged weapons still have placeholder laserswords/rifles for their Tux holding
	 and attack animations. If you are skilled with 3D modeling, please help us out to fix this.
   * When you start the game in OpenGL mode and something overlays the FreedroidRPG window while starting
	 up, the background images looks very strange. If you click on one of the menu items, it should return to
	 looking as intended.
   * Alt tab in/out of the game in OpenGL while a static popup is displayed makes the screen completely black.
	 Clicking or pressing the required key to close the popup will redraw/bring back the screen.

 Windows
   * Using the tool IZarc to unpack the downloaded zip breaks the game. IZarc apparently can not
	 handle filenames without extensions. Please use other options, e.g. 7zip, winzip, winrar etc, to
	 correctly unpack the game.

 Mac
   * Open Files: OSX max number of open files defaults to 256 (as of 10.6). This can lead to errors when
	 loading images: "In Function: get_iso_image_from_file_and_path. Could not load image
	 /usr/local/share/freedroidrpg/graphics/obstacles/<filename>.png"
	 Solution:
		1) Check value of open files limit with $ ulimit -n
		2) Set new value for open files limit with $ ulimit -n 2048
	(issue #2913487)
   * Font rendering: If you get no fonts in the main menu with SDL or if in openGL mode, the game dies
	with the error message "In Function: PutCharFont. Surface for character 46 was NULL pointer!",
	check your display configuration and set the color profile to sRGB.
	(issues #2913485 and #2913484)
   * SDL installed via MacPorts: SDL installed via MacPorts will give freedroidRPG wrong information
	about the byteorder if you have a big-endian (PowerPC) CPU, so the colors may be wrong and you
	probably couldn't start a new game because FreedroidRPG crashes.
	To fix it, with root privileges edit the /opt/include/SDL/SDL_config.h file so the line
		#define SDL_BYTEORDER=1234
	says
		#define SDL_BYTEORDER=4321
	After editing and saving the file recompile freedroidRPG and it should work correctly.
	Using SDL compiled from source instead of from MacPorts will work as well.

 Linux
   * Pulseaudio: Using SDL-pulseaudio you are currently likely not to get sound. This has nothing to do
	 with FreedroidRPG but with Pulseaudio and its plugins still in general being immature. We recommend using
	 e.g. SDL-esd or SDL-alsa until these problems has been fixed upstream.
   * Intel 915/945/IDG graphics cards (EEE PCs, netbooks, etc): Mesa 7.9-devel has an issue which makes the game
   	 run slowly and consume a lot of memory. It is fixed by installing and launching 'driconf' and setting 
	 'Enable texture tiling' to 'No'.   
   * Due to hardware and software drivers, the "Gamma Correction" option may affect nothing.

5. Screen resolution
=====================
 There are a few hidden high resolution settings only accessible from command line. They are badly tested
 and thus generally considered to be buggy and are unsupported. They however can still be quite useful for
 many, especially for widescreen LCDs in fullscreen mode.

 To get an up-to-date list of available resolutions use "freedroidRPG -r99".

 Some known issues for the unsupported resolutions:
	- Portrait image in dialogs overflows its borders
	- Off center light radius
	- Incorrect text scrolling when talking to NPCs at times


6. FAQ
============
Miscellaneous FAQ:

	Q: Do I have to have Linux to try out FreedroidRPG?
	A: While using Linux is greatly recommended for the sanity of the system
	   administrator, FreedroidRPG has MS-Windows executables available.
	   Note that since the FreedroidRPG development team doesn't use 
	   MS-Windows, it gets much less testing. Help with testing and feedback 
	   from Windows users thus is greatly appreciated.

	Q: How can I subscribe/unsubscribe to the mailing list?
	A: FreedroidRPG has two mailing lists. One is for discussing stuff related to
	   FreedroidRPG, the other one is a list with auto-generated change logs from our 
	   developer server and therefore usually only interesting for developers themselves.
	   In any case, you can subscribe, unsubscribe or change your membership options
			from the following web page:
	   http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=54521


Graphics FAQ:

	Q: The game is *extremely* slow on my system running Windows and using OpenGL output.
	A: It might be that you're using the OpenGL drivers that came with your
	   operating system from Microsoft. These drivers don't use hardware acceleration
	   and are therefore extremely slow. You'll have to download and install a real
	   OpenGL capable driver for you graphics card. Usually these can be downloaded 
	   from the home page of the graphics chip manufacturer, typically Nvidia, AMD/ATI,
	   etc. Note, that if you do absolutely cannot get OpenGL working reliably on your
	   system, you can still run the game in pure SDL output mode. For this, you
	   must either use a 'MS-DOS command line prompt' and type

	   freedroidRPG -n 

	   inside this command line, or you can also make a link to freedroidRPG.exe
	   and then edit the link properties and add the -n after freedroidRPG.exe in
	   the link properties dialog box.

	Q: The game is *extremely* slow on my Linux machine with OpenGL enabled.
	A: The reason for this might be that you're not using hardware accelerated OpenGL.
	   Software OpenGL should be avoided.  If you don't have hardware-accelerated
	   OpenGL on your system (because e.g. your graphics card manufacturer doesn't
	   make suitable Linux drivers), you might be much better off when disabling
	   OpenGL support altogether.  For this, you can use command line switch -n,
	   i.e type

	   freedroidRPG -n

	   to start the game with OpenGL output disabled.  Graphics will revert to
	   pure SDL mode.

Sound FAQ:

	Q: My sound isn't working with FreedroidRPG. I don't hear anything.
	A: 1.)  Make sure your sound is working with other applications. If you
		    don't hear anything when trying to play simple mp3 files or ogg files,
		    then the sound system on your machine is not properly set up and it's
		    not a freedroidRPG related problem. In that case, you must install your
		    sound card properly first.
	   2.)  See if you have the SDL_mixer libraries installed. You might want
		    to use "locate SDL_mixer" and see if you get a lot of results.  If
		    not, then the missing SDL_mixer library is the problem.
		    Also check if you have libogg and libvorbis installed.
	   3.)  If you're compiling from source, make sure the ./configure script has
		    properly detected the SDL_mixer library. Just look at the ./configure
		    output. There should be a line like:

		      checking for Mix_ChannelFinished in -lSDL_mixer... yes

		    If you get instead something like

		      checking for Mix_ChannelFinished in -lSDL_mixer... no

		    then the ./configure script didn't detect your SDL_mixer
		    installation. You might want to make sure you've got SDL_mixer and
		    SDL_mixer_devel packages installed or install SDL_mixer from source.
		    You can download everything from here:

		      http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/

		    If you compiled from source, you'll have to recompile now, because the
		    previous compile didn't include the sound module of FreedroidRPG. If
		    the SDL_mixer stuff is installed properly, it should work after the
		    recompile.

	Q: My sound is lagging behind. Every sound seems to be somewhat out of sync.
	A: There might be a sound daemon running on your system.  Many window managers
	   like e.g. KDE start a sound daemon by default upon start up. To get rid of
	   the most common sound daemons, you can try (best as root)

	   killall -9 artsd
	   killall -9 esd
	   killall -9 yiff
	   killall -9 pulseaudio

	   After that, you might want to try freedroidRPG again. The sound lag should
	   not be present anymore.

Level Editor & Developer FAQ:

	Q: Is there a Level editor?
	A: Yes, we have a level editor integrated into FreedroidRPG. It can be accessed
       from the main menu or executing

		  freedroidRPG -e

       It has tooltips on every button to help you find your
       way. Play around with it a bit by yourself and don't hesitate to ask for
       assistance on IRC or the mailing list.

	Q: How can I get the latest development version of the game?
	A: This is very simple when using Linux. You can find the details here:
	   https://sourceforge.net/svn/?group_id=54521
	   If you are using Windows we recommend using a tool like 
	   http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/
	   If you still run into problems, best again discuss it with the people on
	   the freedroid-discussion mailing list.

	Q: I want to help out with FreedroidRPG development.  What should I do first?
	A: Best thing is to first subscribe to the freedroid-discussion mailing list.
	   Then the next thing to do is to get the latest development version of the game
	   from SVN, then to either make a small patch right away or to discuss anything
	   bigger you have in mind with the people on the discussion mailing list, so it
	   can be assured that all the developers are pulling in the same direction and
	   know what's going on and who is working on what.
	   If you are new to the Sourceforge, you should also take at least a brief look
	   at our Sourceforge project pages. You can find the main page here
	   http://sourceforge.net/projects/freedroid
	   and other relevant pages should be reachable from there.
	   A link to our forum can be found near the end of this file.
