Nr=0  Text=_" Hi! I'm new here."
NPC=_"Great! A newcomer! Welcome! Welcome! I'm Skippy, and I'm your new best friend!"
NPC=_"And as a special favour I'll sell you a mapping device for half price!"
NPC=_"What a GREAT offer! You're so lucky!"
LuaCode={

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Nr=2  Text=_" How do I activate such a map-making device?"
NPC=_"Oh, that's so simple. No need to activate anything at all."
NPC=_"Just put that thing on your head, and the nanotechnological bots will enter your body."
NPC=_"They'll merge with your eyes and transmit data to your brain using the optical nerves. Nice, eh?"
NPC=_"Everything within 7 meters of you will be displayed on your retinas."
NPC=_"(Just press tab to see the automap.)"

NPC=_"Oh, I've always been a geek. And I got blueprints from before the Great Assault."

Nr=4  Text=_" Nanotechnology? Isn't that dangerous?"
NPC=_"No way, man, I guarantee it. Don't believe anything you might have heard."
NPC=_"This is a perfectly safe and tried technology. No risk at all! Really!"
NPC=_"There is no risk of your head being eaten by a nanotechnological nightmare, or anything funny like that."
NPC=_"Trust me! I'm your best friend and I wouldn't lie to you! Never!"
