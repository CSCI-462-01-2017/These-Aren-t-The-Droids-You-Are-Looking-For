  What a great day.
    Yes, I'm being sarcastic again.
      The whole planet is in flames.
        Thousands of people are very dead.
          Qwerty and Arensito are not responding.

        Ah, yes, I almost forgot.
       The bloody bots are about to find me, too.
      I'm not very happy with that, Not happy at all.
     I guess I have to pretend I'm just a nice rock, yet again.
    Don't you think it would be a great time to wake up?
   Get up. Get here. Save my ass.
  Please.

    Dvorak, First AI

 Left clicking an enemy will cause Tux to come close to the bot and to start attacking it with the current weapon. If the current weapon is a gun then Tux will stand still and shoot the bot.

 it.  To take over a hostile bot, select the takeover/chat skill from 
 the skills screen (level 1), then click the right mouse button to initiate 
 takeover.
 For the takeover game, you can use the mouse wheel or the cursor keys.

 click anywhere on the screen.
