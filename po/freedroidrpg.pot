"                       HOW TO CONTRIBUTE\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"FreedroidRPG is entirely free software and free artwork.\n"
"It is developed exclusively by volunteers in their leisure time.\n"
"\n"
"FreedroidRPG depends on these contributions to become a better game.  If you "
"would like to contribute something, but are not completely sure how, here's "
"a list of things:\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"   TESTING AND BUG REPORTING:\n"
"\n"
"We need people to try out the game and report anything that does not work "
"correctly or seems to be unstable. This includes minor things, such as "
"spelling mistakes and the like. The task of testing is growing with the size "
"of FreedroidRPG. We need your help.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"   MAP IMPROVEMENTS:\n"
"\n"
"We are looking for people who would make maps for us. There is already an "
"editor built into the game. Feel free to try it, and if you like it make "
"sure to get back to us.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"   VOICE SAMPLES:\n"
"\n"
"Currently we are not accepting new speech. All of the dialogues are being "
"rewritten, we will add voice to them later. If you are one of our old voice "
"actors, then please get in touch with the team.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"   SOUND EFFECTS:\n"
"\n"
"We sure could use some sound effects. If you want to contribute some to a "
"good cause we will not say no to that. :) \n"
"\n"
"\n"
"   CONTACT:\n"
"\n"
"If you would like to contribute something or give some feedback concerning "
"the game, you can easily get in contact with the developers. Just send an e-"
"mail to the following address:\n"
"\n"
"freedroid-discussion@lists.sourceforge.net\n"
"\n"
"Or, if you prefer that, you might want to pop into our IRC channel "
"(#freedroid on irc.freenode.net) Everyone's invited. Bring your friends and "
"coke, beer for Basse and Arthur.\n"
"\n"
"Thank you,\n"
"\n"
"                The FreedroidRPG dev team.\n"
"                                      \n"
