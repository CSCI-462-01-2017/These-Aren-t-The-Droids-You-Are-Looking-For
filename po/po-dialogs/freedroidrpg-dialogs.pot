#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:339

msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:340
msgid "When we get low on ammo, we send in a chain gang of criminals and sluggards into mine shaft K-17."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:341

msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:371
msgid "What makes the exterminator so powerful?"
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:374
msgid "That's a tricky question. Most of the force comes from the miniature nuclear explosions which happen once the bullet hits something."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:375
msgid "Of course, the high velocity of the impact can cause tremendous devastation by itself."

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:376

msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:199

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:346

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:355
msgid "In the years since you entered stasis, mankind has done much research in the field of robotics."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:356
msgid "One branch in particular that has served us well is the realm of nanotechnology."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:357
msgid "Because they run a very simple operating system, nanobots were not affected by whatever caused the Great Assault."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:358
msgid "To this day, our armor and clothing are made out of nanobots. This enables many different sizes of people to wear the same clothing."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:359
msgid "The nanobots reshape the garment for a comfortable fit, so even you should be able to wear them without problem."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:366

msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:368
msgid "Well, it can help you avoid indecent exposure charges."

msgid "But all jokes aside, the bots will not mess around."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:371
msgid "Even the best of fighters sometimes get hit by enemy blows. If I were you, I would seriously consider wearing some sort of armor before mixing it up with those bots."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:372
msgid "They will help to mitigate some of the damage you take from melee or ranged combat."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:373
msgid "Keep in mind, though, that there is a chance that your armor will take damage whenever you get hit. Keep an eye on it, or you'll lose it."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:379
msgid "That sounds useful. How do I use armor?"
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:381
msgid "Well, let me start by saying that there are four classes of armor: headgear, shoes, body armor, and shields."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:382
msgid "When you pick up a piece of armor of a particular class, and you don't already have one equipped, you will automatically equip it if you can."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:383
msgid "Picking up armor and items can be accomplished by [b]left clicking[/b] on the item. If your inventory has space, you will pick the item up."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:384
msgid "If you currently have one piece of armor equipped that you would like to swap out for another, simply drag the new armor piece to the current armor piece and left click."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:385
msgid "They will swap places, and you can put the other piece of armor back into your inventory."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:386
msgid "Alternatively, you can drag it into your field of view and drop it on the ground."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:392
msgid "I wouldn't want to lose any armor. What can I do about that?"
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:394
msgid "Well, there are several ways to keep that from happening."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:395
msgid "Equipped items in poor condition will show up yellow and should turn red if in critical condition."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:396
msgid "If you don't unequip an item in poor or critical condition it may be ruined!"
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:397
msgid "There are three things you can do when an item reaches critical condition:"
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:398
msgid "First, you can sell or discard the item."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:399
msgid "Second, you can use your [b]repair equipment[/b] program on the item, which will repair the item at the cost of some of its durability."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:400
msgid "Or third, you can have the item repaired at a shop, which maintains the item's durability at a price."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:406
msgid "You mentioned discarding an item. Why would I want to do that?"
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:408
msgid "Well, I can think of a few reasons."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:409
msgid "You might not have enough room in your inventory for an item you need more, or can sell for more."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:410
msgid "If an item is close to being destroyed, you might also consider dropping it."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:411
msgid "And finally some items give negative status effects, and aren't worth selling."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:412
msgid "Armor or weapons may affect you in different ways."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:413
msgid "Some will help you out, for example by increasing your cooling rate or increasing your dexterity. This is the work of specialized nanobots, but the reverse can happen too."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:423
msgid "Repair equipment program? How do I use that?"
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:425
msgid "Perhaps I should start by explaining programs in general."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:426
msgid "To use a program, select it through your HUD (remember the [b]s key[/b] toggles your [b]Skills/Program menu[/b])."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:427
msgid "After you've selected a program, run the program by right clicking. Depending on the program you can target an enemy, an item, or just the world."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:428
msgid "You can also assign quick-select keys to programs. Simply hover over the program in the Skills/Program menu and press one of the keys [b]F5[/b] to [b]F12[/b]. Then, whenever you press this button, you will select the corresponding program."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:429
msgid "If you're curious what a program does, you can find out by clicking the question mark in the Skills/Program menu."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:430
msgid "Now, to answer your question, you use your repair equipment program by selecting it in the Skills/Program menu, then right clicking on the item you wish to repair."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:434 dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:436
msgid "Run a program by right clicking after it has been selected from the Skills/Program menu. My shoes are damaged, so I might try the repair equipment program on them to slightly repair them."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:443
msgid "I think I'm ready for the next section of the tutorial."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:445
msgid "Ok, I'll open the next door then. But prepare yourself, soon you will learn how to fight against bots in hand-to-hand combat."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:456
msgid "Can you tell me how to fight the bots?"
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:458
msgid "I will certainly try my best."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:459
msgid "It's odd to think that a flightless bird would be such a scrapper, but you Linarians have been surprising us since the beginning."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:460
msgid "We prefer to fight the blamed droids at a distance. They're less likely to rend us limb from limb that way."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:461
msgid "Unfortunately, guns and other ranged weaponry are hard to come by these days."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:462
msgid "That goes double for ammunition. Because these are bots, you really can't effectively keep them at bay by just waving around an empty gun."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:463
msgid "With that in mind, your most reliable weapons are your fists. They never run out of ammo or wear down, but of course they don't do much damage against a metal body, either."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:469
msgid "So I'm supposed to fight bots with my fists?"
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:471
msgid "There may be times when you have no choice."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:472
msgid "Melee combat, armed or unarmed, can be initiated by [b]left clicking[/b] on an enemy."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:473
msgid "You will then walk over to the enemy and start hitting them."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:474
msgid "Now, I understand you may have some concerns over your safety during this..."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:475
msgid "CONCERNS? Erm... Yes, this doesn't sound like a particularly healthy endeavor."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:476

msgstr ""

msgid "I beg your pardon? Who is Fred?"
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:478
msgid "Never mind, just an old song."

msgid "Fighting the bots hand-to-hand has risks, there is no question. However, there are things you can do to even the odds."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:480
msgid "We already discussed armor. Another useful type of item is medical supplies."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:481
msgid "There are a few different types of restorative items. The most common are health drinks."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:487
msgid "Tell me about health drinks."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:489
msgid "Man has practiced medicine in one form or another for hundreds of years."
msgstr ""

msgid "Using some of the same nanotechnology that makes up your armor, we've perfected drinks that instantaneously restore your health."
msgstr ""

msgid "Certain items, like health drinks, can be used directly without clicking on them."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:493
msgid "At the bottom of your HUD, you'll notice your item access belt. Small items can go here and be used by pressing the numbers [b]0[/b] through [b]9[/b]."

msgid "Unlike armor or weapons, multiple of these items will group together in your inventory slots."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:495
msgid "If you have Diet Supplements equipped in item slot 1, you can press 1 to use one."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:496
msgid "This will restore your health, and will be invaluable in the heat of battle."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:497

msgid "Come back and talk to me when you have the Entropy Inverter."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:557
msgid "You mentioned another bot?"

msgid "Lucky for you, there's another dimension to melee combat."

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:644
msgid "There are three basic ways to do this: traditional firearms, lasers, and plasma weapons."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:645
msgid "Traditional firearms are things that go bang. A small explosion accelerates the ammunition towards the target at a high velocity, causing injury."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:646
msgid "Lasers use an intensified beam of light to burn through the intended victim. These operate on replaceable charge packs."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:647
msgid "Plasma weapons use superheated ionized gas to burn the target. The gas comes in loadable canisters."

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:656
msgid "Well, firing is pretty simple. First, equip a ranged weapon that you have ammunition for."

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:657
msgid "Next, simply [b]left click[/b] on your target, and you'll begin firing."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:658

msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:660

msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:667
msgid "If I have equipped a ranged weapon and I left click on an enemy, I will begin firing upon it until my gun is empty, and automatically reload. But if I want to fire a single shot, I need to also equip the Fire Weapon program, and then right click. To move while firing, I have to shift + left click to where I want to go. Also, if I want to manually reload I have to press the 'r' key. The small message screen at the bottom of my HUD will tell me if I'm reloading or out of ammunition."

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:843

msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:846
msgid "Because of this, you can run various programs on the bots."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:847
msgid "You can attempt to take them over, or monkey with their programming, or even cause them to damage themselves."

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:861
msgid "However, you did leave yourself instructions before you went into stasis sleep."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:862
msgid "Taking over a bot comes in the form of a game or competition placing you against the bot."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:863

msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:866
msgid "Your objective is to activate as many cores in your chosen color as possible at the end of each round."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:867
msgid "This is accomplished by selecting a wire with the up or down buttons, then pressing spacebar to activate that core."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:868
msgid "You will be given about 10 seconds initially to select which color you want with spacebar."

msgstr ""

msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:871
msgid "I can tell you about some more advanced techniques, if you'd like."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:873

msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:881
msgid "What was that about activating more cores than the bot?"
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:883
msgid "Ah, yes. While you are busy trying to take the bot over, it will be busy trying to stop you."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:884
msgid "The truth is, if the bot programming was perfect, it would be almost impossible to defeat."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:885
msgid "Fortunately for you, software bugs do indeed exist, and therefore some cores will be on your side from the beginning."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:886
msgid "Likewise, the bots only have a limited number of charges. Occasionally, they will have more than you, but that is a risk you have to take."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:887
msgid "Because you are initiating the attack, you do get to choose your side, which can let you handicap the bot greatly if used wisely."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:893
msgid "Tell me about more advanced techniques."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:895
msgid "Each charge will activate and remain active for a certain amount of time. This will let you take over a core that a bot just took over."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:896
msgid "Sometimes, the bots will already have charges on the wires. When you activate one of these, it will increase the time that wire is activated for."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:897
msgid "The bot can use this trick too, so it may be wise to give up a heavily guarded wire for an easier target."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:898
msgid "The wiring inside the bots sometimes contain splitters. These can be used in two ways."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:899
msgid "A 2-to-1 splitter is undesirable. This requires two charges to activate one core, halving your efficiency."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:900
msgid "A 1-to-2 splitter, however, will activate two nodes for the price of one charge."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:901
msgid "Sometimes these splitters will be stacked. Tracing the route ahead of time will be crucial to your tactical success."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:902
msgid "Ideally, you want to stick your opponent with 2-to-1 splitters, while you have 1-to-2 splitters at your disposal."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:903
msgid "Finally, remember that patience is often a virtue. Taking over all cores early on only to lose them later can be a crushing blow."

msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:911

msgid "You seem to be able to handle quite a bit of heat, but you have your limits."

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:916
msgid "If you do not use all charges when attempting to take over a bot, you will spare some heat."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:917
msgid "Not activating all charges or beating the bot with a comfortable winning margin is less exhaustive for you."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:918
msgid "If you nevertheless accumulate too much heat, you will automatically shut down in order to cool off."
msgstr ""
